made outline document. I think I remembered most of the product features I was interested in

Made initial layout in UiEditor

The prog was prompting me when I hit save, so I looked and the name said Form1 for the 
so I set the caption to MazeBuilder 1.0 (b) for beta, then changed back to look at the name field (I saw it matching the change to Caption) and then the preview form disappeared and the main window was unresponsive. I had to kill the editor without saving.

Recalling the undo file I snapshotted everything in the InForm directory, and tried tinkering with the undo function, finding that I could advance the "head" of the undo by just making or moving widgets around. After that copying UiEditorUndo.dat from my snapshot made the undo command restore my lost layout.  Neat

Appears that can-have-focus doesn't work, for buttons, at least; modeified .frm to explicitly set values to false

Couldn't get begindraw to work on my PB, no matter what

Tues
Made a repo for MazeBuilder

Adapting my old code. I expect it to take really really well

Will I need the control ID to be derive-able from the name of picture box jigsaws?  I don't think so.

Here comes the project's first big design decision: how to implement my group of tiles?

I think I need to use two widgets per tile: a frame to move and detect clicks, and a PB to display my tile offset by an amount (x,y) of course.

Updated repo

Have a really frustrating and annoying experience with List Box control items not being selectable on a particular List

I've gradually realized because of the hackery I employ to display tiles, and how InForm's hover function presently only gives the top widget's ID, I'll have to write helper functions for every little thing. Hopefully it didn't create too much work.

On the other hand, writing up the event functions *feels* easy.

I'm tired of writing translations of indexing systems.

Zordering seems to fail as pertains to frames. specifically when no child (contained) widgets's ordered above its parent then no widget can be above the frame, regardless of order, but this is inconsistent & to be above the frame a widget would need to be above all child widgets of frame.
As the zorder dialog list shows order to be first-created:lowest z, there should be no trouble creating a frame and then its children programmatically, but to reiterate, this might be inconsistent.

Lacking any clue, I will probably just drop a few features and revert to a simpler implementation mainly right now I need a hint to continue, about what can be done about controlling zorder
